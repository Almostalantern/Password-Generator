# Password-Generator
This is a random password generator. It's capable of generating a random password between 8 - 128 characters long. You can choose whether to use upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in this password. It is a useful thing if you need a password on the fly and don't want to put any effort into thinking of one.
